	    <h2>Using Caddy Magic</h2>
	    <p>Using Caddy Magic couldn't be much simpler.  Download your course, 
	    or map it yourself (which is really easy... you don't even have to go out of your way - it just takes 
	    playing a round...)
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Once you are out on the tee, pick your hole and it will be displayed on the map.
	    Click any part of the map and you will be told how far away that point is from your 
	    current position.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Mapping a course</h2>
	    
	    <p>
	        Mapping your home course is easy.  Simply take your phone 
	        around the course next time you're out and mark each of the holes out as you play them.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        You only need to mark the tee and the green on each hole. Next time you play, you'll get full
	        distance information for each hole.
	    </p>
	    <p> Once your course is mapped, you can upload it and share with other users, so hopefully we can build up
	        quite a little catalogue to share with each other... Helpful for those away days...
